MicroMasters

A series of credit-eligible courses recognized by industry.

Speed is critical in software development. Successful developers are those who are able to quickly learn new technologies and new software systems, and they do this . by seeing any software – in any programming language – as common repeating patterns, not just detailed lines of code.

In this MicroMasters program, you will learn this same kind of expert thinking. By working through several software development projects, you will learn specific technologies, including Java, JUnit, IntelliJ IDEA, Typescript and Node.js. But even more important, you will develop the ability to see the common structures in programs and in tools and learn how to apply these skills to master new technologies quickly.

Upon completion of this program, you will be able to write programs using a systematic approach and to design programs that are easy to maintain. You will also learn how to use agile methods in order to build software programs that solve real world problems.

With the skills obtained in this program, you will have the confidence to apply for positions that use any programming language or technology.

### Job Outlook
