Computer Science Degree Requirements 2018-2019
--------------------------

Computer programming, algorithms, data structures, and languages play an increasingly important role in academic, science and business careers. The Associate in Science degree satisfies the transfer requirements of many disparate 4-year colleges and universities. Our up-to-date curriculum is also valuable for enhancing the career opportunities of working professionals.

### Program Learning Outcomes:

• Students will be able to use standard software engineering tools to create reusable code.  
• Students will be able to design a large program that takes advantage of existing code libraries.  
• Students will be able to organize a complex program in a logical way, enabling the extension of the program.  
• Students will be able to comprehend user requirements and produce code and documentation in an industry-accepted style that satisfies those requirements.  
• Students will be able to develop software that solves problems in a variety of fields, including math, physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, business, and the Internet.

### Career Opportunities:

The local Silicon Valley industry continues to need qualified software engineers, system administrators, software quality assurance engineers and systems integrators.
