“Python For Everyone” by Horstmann &Necaise

a book of your choice.  
Please choose whatever book looks best to you, but make sure it covers Python VERSION 3.

We will be studying Python VERSION 3 in this class, so it is critical that you download and install VERSION 3 of the Python language before completing the first assignment. There is information in the Modules about how to do this.

Each week you will have a **programming assignment** and a Discussion question to answer. Note that the assignment and Discussion question are due at midnight on Tuesdays. You can submit a late assignment or resubmit an assignment if it will raise your score. I take _one point off for each week_ that an assignment is submitted or resubmitted after the due date.

You can take the **midterm** during any one hour window between Thursday, 24 May, at 8:00 am ~and~ Sunday, 27 May at midnight.

You can take the **final exam** during any two hour window between Thursday, 21 June at 8:00 am ~and~ Tuesday, 26 June at midnight.

1.1 Information about this course
=================================

At the end of this course, you will be able to design, implement and test Python 3 programs. You will be able to use modules created by others as well as create your own Python modules. Analysis, problem solving, object oriented programming and software engineering principles such as modularity and documentation will be stressed.

#### **Office Hours**:

Wednesdays at noon in Main Campus Room 4114. Other times I can have a face-to-face meeting or a telephone conference with you if you send me an Inbox Message through Canvas with your telephone number and a good time to meet or a good time for me to call you.

#### **Laboratory:**

Use the computers on campus (STEM Center), or download and install **Python 3** on your own computer. There are also computers for your use on the second floor of the Sunnyvale Center in the computer lab.

A book of your choice. Please choose whatever book looks best to you, but make sure it covers Python 3.

**Prerequisite**:

Math 105 or 108, or successful completion of intermediate algebra. Previous experience with any programming language (not including HTML nor SQL). 

#### **Grading:**

There will be 10 homework assignments, each one is a Python program. Your homework points will be weighted as 50% of your total grade; your midterm and final exam points together will be weighted as 40% of your total course grade. Each week I will post a question to our Canvas Discussion forum; you are required to respond to these questions each week, and your responses will be weighted as 10%. You must pass the final in order to pass the class.

If you earn 97% (or more) of the points available in the class, you get an "A+"; 93% earns an "A"; 90% earns an "A-"; 87% earns a "B+"; 83% earns a "B"; 80% earns a "B-"; 77% earns a "C+"; 70% earns a "C"; 67% earns a "D+"; 63% earns a "D"; 60% earns a "D-"; and below 60% earns an "F".

#### **Academic Honesty:**

The work you turn in must be your own. You may ask others for assistance, but your solution must have your "thumbprint" on it, and not be the same as any other student's. If two students turn in identical papers, both students receive zero, with no chance to redo.

If you find code on the internet and incorporate it into your solution, you must credit the author of the code by including a link to the website where you found it. If you use submit a solution under your name and you did nothing but change the variable names, you will be given a 0 with no chance to resubmit.

#### **Laboratory Submissions:**

For each lab assignment, you must submit both the listing of your program and the run. I will not grade a lab assignment that does not include proof that it runs, which is in the form of a recording of what happens when you run it. Late labs get 1 point off for each _week_ that they are late. This means that if your assignment is one hour late or 6 1/2 days late, it will still get 1 point off. If your lab is over 7 days late, it will get 2 points off, etc. You _can_ redo an assignment, but it will be counted off for being late.
