If you have a financial need that will prevent you from affording this zyBook, send a Canvas Inbox message to Elaine Haight (your instructor) for help.

**GRADING:**

There will be 10 Lab Assignments (zyLabs) make up 50% of your grade. Midterm exam is worth 15% and Final exam is worth 35%.

If you earn 97% (or more) of the points available in the class, you get an "A+"; 93% earns an "A"; 90% earns an "A-"; 87% earns a "B+"; 83% earns a "B"; 80% earns a "B-"; 77% earns a "C+"; 70% earns a "C"; 67% earns a "D+"; 63% earns a "D"; 60% earns a "D-"; and below 60% earns an "F".

**MIDTERM EXAM**: Take it here on Canvas during any one hour period between:  
Mon, 21 May, 8:00 am  ~ and ~ Thur, 24 May, midnight

**FINAL EXAM**: Take it here on Canvas during any two hour period between:  
Thur, 21 June, 8:00 am  ~ and ~ Tues, 26 June, midnight

The following list shows the due dates for the first few lab assignments. You will receive one point off for each WEEK that an assignment is late. Whether you submit an assignment an hour late or a week late, it will receive just one point off. 

You can redo and resubmit an assignment if it will improve your score. If you resubmit your assignment after the due date, it will be counted as late.

Important Information about this course
=======================================

[](https://foothillcollege.instructure.com/courses/6325/files/983420/download?wrap=1 "Syllabus-1ANight.pdf")At the end of this course, you will be able to design, implement and test object oriented computer programs containing repetition, variation and input/output. Analysis, problem solving and software engineering principles such as modularity and documentation will be stressed.

#### **Meetings**:

This class is held entirely online, on this Canvas website. You will access your zyBook through this Canvas website. There will be no synchronous meeting times. Most people take approximately six hours to complete each lab assignment. This does not include the time it takes you to read the material.

#### **Prerequisite**:

Math 105 or 108, or successful completion of elementary algebra. Familiarity with computer operation.

#### **Required Participation**:

The State of California (who funds the college) requires that you actively participate in this course. To avoid being dropped for non-participation, you need to **start studying the first week.** At a minimum, you need to complete and submit "zyLab #1: Adding Salestax" before the due date. At any point during the quarter, you will be dropped from the class if two weeks pass by without your submitting at least one complete lab assignment. If you have trouble completing an assignment, please see "Places to go for help" on the Home page of this site.

#### **Working Together:**

The work you turn in must be your own. You may ask others for assistance, but your solution must have your "thumbprint" on it, and not be the same as any other student's. If two students turn in identical papers, both students receive zero, with no chance to redo.

#### **Laboratory Submissions:**

You can use your own computer to access our Canvas website and your zyBook, or you can use the computers in the STEM Center on Campus room 4213 and upstairs in the Sunnyvale Center. If you would like to apply to get a free, refurbished laptop from the college, contact Joe, OTI Program Coordinator, at 408-864-5712 or lipsigjoseph@fhda.edu

Please submit only complete laboratory assignments. Late labs get 1 point off for each week that they are late. You can resubmit a lab assignment for more points, but it will be counted as late. For example, if you submit or resubmit an assignment 3 days after the due date, one late point will be deducted.

**Approach to Programming** 

*   We will emphasize real world software engineering methodology. You will not succeed if you program like a hobbyist.
*   Our Program Guidelines will seem strict or time consuming, but are REQUIRED. These guidelines enforce a style that allows you to write large, robust and modifiable programs.
*   I give feedback on your lab assignments very quickly, immediately after the due date. It is very important that you read my feedback on your lab assignment _before_ submitting the next assignment.
*   You can resubmit for more points, but one point will be deducted for each week after the due date. For example, if you submit or resubmit an assignment 3 days after the due date, one late point will be deducted.
