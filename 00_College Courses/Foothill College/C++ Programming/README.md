# Course Syllabus

# CS 2A

# Fall 2018

## S.1 Course Description and Prerequisite

CS 1A is an introduction to computer programming using the C++
language. Absolute beginners or students already familiar with other
programming languages will learn how to write C++ programs that
cover a wide range of applications. The ability to work with computers
and access to the Internet are the only prerequisites. For success,
however, you will also need both a desire to learn and a positive
attitude.

A working facility with simple algebra as well as good written English
comprehension skills are both strong advisories.

## S.2 Instructor

My name is Jesse Cecil, and you can email me at
ceciljesse@fhda.edu. Typically you will ask questions through the
private or public message center here in the course and only use email
if you have trouble logging in.

## S.3 Text and References

All of the important concepts will be covered in my modules. The text
for the course is _recommended_ , not required. It is _Absolute C++, any
Edition_ (6th or prior), by Walter Savitch, Addison Wesley. You must
have **some** reference, however, you can use any C++ texbook that fits
your style and budget. You can order this through the Foothill
Bookstore at [http://books.foothill.edu/,](http://books.foothill.edu/,) phone: (650) 949-7305.


### S.4 Compilers

In this class I will be using **Microsoft Visual**

**Studio/C++** for **Windows** users and **Xcode** for for Mac users.

I have handouts for Eclipse for C/C++ Developers for the Mac, but
I no longer recommend Eclipse for C++ on the Mac.

If you are facile on another Integrated Development Environment
(IDE), you are welcome to use that, instead. However, my assistance
in the forums regarding compiler specifics will be limited to **Visual**

**Studio** and **Xcode** (with some limited help for Eclipse).

### S.5 Communication

Questions and comments should be posted to the Discussions on
the left menu. I will usually reply reasonably quickly. Unless a
question is of a private nature (i.e. grades, registration issues), please
use the Discussions. Also feel free to answer your fellow student
questions, even if you only have a guess as to what the answer is. It's
great to engage in conversation with each other in this manner.

If you have a new topic, please start a new discussion. If you want to
add to or ask about an existing topic, " **Reply** " to that discussion.

Office hours will be online using **Conferences** , which you can attend
each week by going to the link on the left side of the screen. Watch for
an announcement regarding the day and times.

I will answer email and discussion questions each day of the week.
Please allow up to 24 hours for responses, but many times sooner.

#### Discussion Required for each Assignment

#### Points are awarded for contributions to the Questions

#### area for each Assignment. It's good collegial form to


#### participate, inquire and assist. You can post a

#### question, answer a question, or give an observation

#### about computer science in general. Also, you must

#### post an introduction in the first week of class or you

#### will be dropped as a "no show" according to the

#### college requirements.

#### Do Not Post Homework Code

Whether you have a question or suggested answer, never post exact
homework code to forums. Create a separate small program to display
your issue or illustration. For details, see the required resource module
Pasting Code into Questions.

STEM Tutorial Center

If the online forums here are not enough, please visit the STEM
Tutorial Center page, and click **Schedule and Available
Instructors**. These people are qualified to help you with
assignments or modules without giving you an answer that will short-
circuit your discovery process. Let them know that you are not to
receive actual assignment solution code or even fragments. They
probably know this already, but it's your responsibility to avoid
submitting something that was written by a tutor or another person.

Online tutoring will be available with them as well from 8pm - 12am
almost every evening. Check the schedule.

Private Messages


Please use Discussions for any question or comment that relates to
the class. If you have a confidential question ( grades or registration)
use the Inbox link to send a message.

Posting Program Code

You can post code to the public discussions that is not directly from
your assignment. If you have an assignment question, translate that
into a piece of code that does not reveal your answer or submission,
exactly.

When posting code fragments (i.e., portions of your program) into
questions, make sure these code fragments are perfectly indented and
that they are properly formatted. For details, see the required
resource module Pasting Code into Questions.

Do not post _entire programs_ and ask "what's wrong?" or "is this
good?" This is frivolous and indicates you have not tried to narrow
down the problem. Find exactly what you want to know about and
post only that part of the code.

### S.6 Where Everything Happens

Access the various areas of your course through the menu on the left.

```
 Assignments: submitted through the Assignments.
```
```
 Tests: taken through the Quizzes
```
```
 Questions or comments: posted using the Discussions.
```
### S.7 Grades

Your grades are based on programming **lab assignments** (
points = 70%), Discussions (20 points = 7%), and exams (20 + 40 =
60 points = 23%).


```
Absolute Grading Scale
```
```
% needed for this grade
```
```
100 A+
94 A
90 A-
87 B+
84 B
80 B-
77 C+
70 C
60 D
< 60 F
```
### S.8 Drops and Withdrawal

For a complete reference of all withdrawal dates and deadlines, refer
to the Foothill College registration page at the college web site here:

```
Information link this quarter
```
You will be dropped by me for any of the following:


```
 Missing a scheduled test (no matter how small) without prior notice
will result in an automatic drop or a zero, depending on the situation
and my judgment.
 If you do not login or I do not hear from you by email for 10
consecutive days I may drop you. (See exception below.)
 If you receive a zero on, or fall behind in, two consecutive lab
assignments or three lab assignments, total, I will drop you. (See
exception below.)
```
Exception to Above Policies:

If the non-participation that has just been described occurs partially
beyond the last date to drop, then I may not be able to drop you, and
you may receive whatever grade that your points dictate. Therefore
don't assume that you can simply stop participating late in the
quarter and you will be dropped. If you intend to drop please do so
yourself, so you don't accidentally end up with an unintended "F."

If you decide to drop the class, please let me know. I cannot allow
anyone who has dropped to continue to have access to the material.

### S.9 Collaboration

**Working together on homework = ZERO + Dean of Student's Office. (See the
Academic Integrity flyer in the announcements)**

##### Husbands and wives, roommates, and friends taking the course

##### together: don't discuss ungraded homework with each other

##### outside the public forums. Instead, direct all of your

##### questions to the public forums where everyone can comment

##### and I can moderate the discussion. Do not look for answers on

##### cheater web sites or pay-for-help web sites.

Any variation of collaborating or copying programming lab
assignments is prohibited. The assignment must be 100% your own
work. Changing a few variables around to make them look different


won't fool me. And if it does fool me, you probably had to change so
many things that you knew enough to do it yourself in the first place!

You can talk about the modules all day long off-line if you wish. This
rule only applies to lab assignments. There is a place to ask for help
with homework: the public forums labeled for that purpose. I will
spend hours helping you each week, both individually, and in groups.
You can even answer each other's questions in the **_public_** forums. (If
I think you are giving too much information away, I'll edit your
post.) So there is no reason to ask your fiancée or your cousin's
neighbor's lead guitarist.

If you accept help from someone who is not trained to teach without
giving away the answer, it will short-circuit your learning process --
you will actually become weaker. Now, you don't have to agree with
me - but you do have to follow the rule. If you want to take a class
where you get to solve problems in groups, you'll have to take the
course from someone else. But if you stay in _this_ class, you are
agreeing to do the lab assignments on your own or with help from us,
here, in this course's public forum.

For those of you wishing to give help please do not give away the
answer. Either tell the person where they can look to find the
solution, give them a general idea or ask them to ask me. Don't post
actual assignment code.

### S.10 How to Ask a Question Questions

_"There's no such thing as a bad question"_ is a myth. I don't know how
the rumor got started.

It is easy to make sure your question is a good one: Make it
specific. An example of a bad question is, _"My program doesn't
work. Here it is. Would you please see if you can tell me what I am
doing wrong? Gretel."_ Gretel is _lazy_. An example of a good question
is, _"My program doesn't work. Through trial and error I have
determined that the problem lies in the following five lines, but I_


_can't seem to narrow it down any further. Can you
help? Hansel."_ Hansel made an attempt to organize and isolate the
problem prior to asking for help. When he gets my answer, he is sure
to remember it because he is prepared to hear exactly what he needs
to know.

Another example: BAD: _"I don't understand the assignment. I'm
lost. Please help. Jack."_ The reason this is a bad question is that
there are a million things I might say to get Jack on the right track,
but I can't know which ones to focus on because I don't know where
Jack's misunderstanding lies. Jack hasn't given me any help to help
him. GOOD: I _understand the homework description up until you
say 'XYZ'. But I'm not sure what you mean by 'XYZ'. In the lectures
'XYZ' seems to be ... but here it seems to mean something
different. From that point on, things get hazy because of this
mismatch. Would you resolve this apparent difference for
me? Jill."_ Here, Jill has told me exactly the first point at which she is
confused so I know what to tell her to set her straight.

I am not discouraging questions: I love them. Through them, I get a
chance to communicate with you all. But narrow down the
question. Show me you have tried to answer it and have made some
progress. Show me exactly where you seem to be faltering so I can
know how to help you. The same holds true if you are posing your
question to a fellow student or to the whole class.

## S.12 Weekly Activities

Every week you have two lessons, or Modules, to study and one Lab Assignment to turn
in. There are exceptions (see calendar, below), but this is the basic drill. This course is a lot
of fun, and a lot of work. To pass it you have to make time to do both of these activities.

Weekly Time Estimate

```
 Module Reading - about 5 hours. This includes pasting code into your
compiler and trying it out.
 Lab Assignment - about 5- 8 hours. This varies greatly with individuals.
Some students take 1 hour, some take 10 hours.
```

Typical Week

Here is the day-by-day breakdown of a typical week. Some weeks differ, but this will help
you understand approximately what you are facing on a daily basis.

Typical Week
Monday (first 2 or 3 weeks only) Read resource module R
Tuesday Read module A
Wednesday Assignment Due (2 PM)
Friday Read module B

S.13 Other Activities: _Discussions_ , _Announcements_ , _Tests_

Discussions

You can ask me or other students’ questions in the Discussion and Private
Messages area. I hope you will be active in this area. Read through the recent
Discussions posts every time you log in to make sure you gain the benefit of other
students' questions.

**You must **_post an introduction_** in the first week to avoid being dropped as a no-
show.**

No Exact Homework Code Allowed

Please phrase questions in plain English or use non-homework code examples to
demonstrate you question or suggested answer when posting.

Follow Module 3R When Posting

Code fragments must be formatted according Module 3R to receive an answer. Otherwise,
we'll ask you to fix the formatting and we'll check back to answer the question once the
formatting is achieved.

Announcements

You will see an Announcement area in the top right of your welcome screen every time you
log in. Keep an eye on that for late-breaking news.

Tests


There is a short exam on _Friday_ of the sixth week and there is a Final Exam on _Tuesday_ of
the 12th week. These tests will be available for two full days prior to the due date. You
must take the tests in that two-day period. I will not accept late quizzes or final exams.

The exams will be remotely proctored, so allow a few extra minutes to get setup. Have
your ID ready and have a web cam and microphone working before you begin.

##### S.14 Official Calendar

It is listed on the syllabus page

Repeat

No late assignments accepted after the Friday of Week 11, just before finals week. Also,
the Final Exam is not accepted late. It is due by midnight, Tuesday of finals week**.** You
have three months to prepare for these deadlines.

Optional Modules

There is an occasional Module C in some weeks. I did not put this on the calendar. These
modules constitute optional reading meant for advanced and ambitious students.

##### S.15 Late Work

The late penalty is 2 points per day. ( _anything past the_ **_due time of 2 PM_** _it is 1 day
late_ ) No assignment will be accepted more than one week late. It is important to keep up
with the class in a timely fashion.

##### S.16 Disability-related Accommodations

To obtain disability-related accommodations, students must contact Disability Resource
Center (DRC) as early as possible in the quarter. To contact DRC, you may:

· Visit DRC in Room 5400
· Email DRC at adaptivelearningdrc@foothill.edu
· Call DRC at 650- 949 - 7017 to make an appointment


If you already have an accommodation notification from DRC, please contact me privately
to discuss your needs.

S.17 Next Steps

Now that you have the idea, you can look up and see that in the first week you are
supposed to read:

```
 Monday - This syllabus and resource R
 Tuesday - Week 1A
 Friday - Week 1B
```
It is a good idea to print out this guide and the syllabus (and any other modules you
wish) for handy reference.

Section 4 - Rules One through Six
=================================

LABS.4.1 Rule One
-----------------

Rule 1

Do not cram code on the left margin.

#### Bad

// constructor for class MyArray that takes int size
MyArray::MyArray(int size)
{
int k;

// bounds check the size
if (size == 0 || size > MAX\_SIZE)
{
   undefine();
   return;
}
// etc ...

#### Better

// constructor for class MyArray that takes int size
MyArray::MyArray(int size)
{
   int k;

   // bounds check the size
   if (size == 0 || size > MAX\_SIZE)
   {
      undefine();
      return;
   }
   // etc ...

The only things that should be on the left margin are the function/method headers (void initArray(...) ) or class headers:

class Fragment
{
   ...

LABS.4.2 Rule Two
-----------------

Rule 2

Indent _for/if/else/while/switch_ bodies.

#### Bad

   // bounds check the size
   if (size == 0 || size > MAX\_SIZE)
   {
   undefine();
   return;
   }

   for (k = 0; k < size; k++)
   data\[k\] = "undefined";

#### Better

   // bounds check the size
   if (size == 0 || size > MAX\_SIZE)
   {
      undefine();
      return;
   }

   for (k = 0; k < size; k++)
      data\[k\] = "undefined";

LABS.4.3 Rule Three
-------------------

Rule 3

Do not indent for no reason.

#### Bad (In first fragment, comment should be aligned with code below)

   // bounds check the size
      if (size == 0 || size > MAX\_SIZE)  _<--bad here_
      {
         undefine();
         return;
      }

   // allocate a new string array of size: size
   data = new string\[size\];
   this->size = size;
      for (k = 0; k < size; k++)     _<--bad here_
         data\[k\] = "default string";

#### Better

   // bounds check the size
   if (size == 0 || size > MAX\_SIZE)
   {
      undefine();
      return;
   }

   // allocate a new string array of size: size
   data = new string\[size\];
   this->size = size;
   for (k = 0; k < size; k++)
      data\[k\] = "default string";

#### Bad

   // allocate a new string array of size: size
      data = new string\[size\];
   this->size = size;

#### Better

   // allocate a new string array of size: size
   data = new string\[size\];
   this->size = size;

LABS.4.4 Rule Four
------------------

Rule 4

Do not randomly stagger code which should be aligned.

#### Bad

   // allocate a new string array of size: size
  data = new string\[size\];
   this.size = size;
    for (k = 0; k < size; k++)
	    ...

#### Better

   // allocate a new string array of size: size
   data = new string\[size\];
   this->size = size;
   for (k = 0; k < size; k++)
	   ...

#### Bad

   int k;

 // bounds check the size
   if (size == 0 || size > MAX\_SIZE)
      {
         undefine();
        return;
   }

#### Better

   int k;

   // bounds check the size
   if (size == 0 || size > MAX\_SIZE)
   {
      undefine();
      return;
   }

LABS.4.5 Rule Five
------------------

Rule 5

Do not use excessive indentation or extra blank lines.

#### Bad (too much indentation)

   // bounds check the size
   if (size == 0 || size > MAX\_SIZE)
   {
          undefine();
          return;
   }

#### Bad (meaningless blank lines)

   // bounds check the size
   if (size == 0 || size > MAX\_SIZE)  
   {  
       undefine();  
       return;  
   }

#### Bad ("double indentation" or "lonely braces")

   // bounds check the size
   if (size == 0 || size > MAX\_SIZE)
      {
          undefine();
          return;
      }

#### Better

   if (size == 0 || size > MAX\_SIZE)
   {
       undefine();
       return;
   }

LABS.4.6 Rule Six
-----------------

Rule 6

Leave a blank space around all operators.

#### Bad (missing space around the \== operator and after the \> operator)

   // bounds check the size
   if (size==0 || size >MAX\_SIZE)
   {
          undefine();
          return;
   }

#### Better

   // bounds check the size
   if (size == 0 || size > MAX\_SIZE)
   {
          undefine();
          return;
   }

#### Bad (missing spaces _**around**_ — or _**on one side**_ of — the assignment, \=, operator)

   // allocate a new string array of size: size
   data=new string\[size\];
   this->size= size;

#### Better

   // allocate a new string array of size: size
   data = new string\[size\];
   this->size = size;

Section 5 - Rules Seven through Thirteen
========================================

LABS.5.1 Rule Seven
-------------------

Rule 7

Do not continue typing on the same line as a "{".

#### Bad

   // bounds check the size
   if (size == 0 || size > MAX\_SIZE)
   {  undefine();
      return;
   }

#### Better

   // bounds check the size
   if (size == 0 || size > MAX\_SIZE)
   {
      undefine();
      return;
   }

LABS.5.2 Rule Eight
-------------------

Rule 8

Do not create long lines that will cause wraparound in some editors (use 80 chars max).

#### Bad

   if (!(poly = createStartingPoly(theNurb, uCount, uNewKnots, dim, dim, uControlPoints, uDegree) ))
   {
      putUpAlert("Couldn't allocate starting poly. No non-uniform-rational-b-spline surface drawn.  Please check your values", FALSE);
      postNurbError(theNurb,GLU\_OUT\_OF\_MEMORY);
      freeLists();
      return 0;
   }

#### Better

   if (!(poly = createStartingPoly(theNurb, uCount,
      uNewKnots, dim, dim, uControlPoints,
      udegree) ))
   {
      putUpAlert("Couldn't allocate starting poly. No non"
         + "-uniform-rational-b-spline surface drawn.  "
         + "Please check your values", FALSE);
      postNurbError(theNurb,GLU\_OUT\_OF\_MEMORY);
      freeLists();
      return 0;
   }

LABS.5.3 Rule Nine
------------------

Rule 9

Don't use tabs in this class.

Tabs expand awkwardly in email or on browsers and create problems. Always substitute _**about 3 spaces**_ for every _**tab**_ character you have in your code, or just avoid using the tabs in the first place.

Many groups have a policy to _**always use tabs**_ or _**never use tabs**_. I don't side with either philosophy but want to make sure you can adapt. Since _**don't use tabs**_ works a little better for teaching, I have chosen that rule. In other settings, I might choose the _**always use tabs**_ rule.

You can either set your editor to automatically use three spaces per indentation level or, after you are done writing, do a global search and replace. 

You can tell the difference between a space and a tab in a document by click/dragging the mouse across the region in question.  If it selects the whitespace gradually, you have spaces.  If nothing selects until you move a large distance, then suddenly the entire region is selected with a _**snap**_, then you have a tab. 

Try selecting this:    and then this:	.

Which one was a tab and which was a string of spaces? 

By now you have seen this rule at least four times: _use tabs, lose points_. I have supplied an entire handout (_**next page**_) on how to avoid ending up with tabs in your code.

LABS.5.4 Rule Ten
-----------------

Rule 10

One space is insufficient indentation.

Use at least three and no more than five per indentation level. Whatever you use for one level, use for all.

#### Bad (1 space not enough)

   // bounds check the size
   if (size == 0 || size > MAX\_SIZE)
   {
    undefine();
    return;
   }

#### Bad (inconsistent: 3 spaces in one place, 5 in another)

   for (k = 0; k < size; k++)
   {
      data\[k\] = "undefined";
      for (j = 0; j < k; j++)
           bean\[j\]\[k\] = "tracking";  _<--not consistent_
   }

#### Better

   for (k = 0; k < size; k++)
   {
      data\[k\] = "undefined";
      for (j = 0; j < k; j++)
         bean\[j\]\[k\] = "tracking";
   }

LABS.5.5 Rule Eleven
--------------------

Rule 11

Use whole words, not single letters, for variables.

Variable names like dimes or temperature are far better than d or t. Do not use single character names. Exceptions are loop counters (n or k are typical) or mathematical or physical constants like _e_, _x_ and _y_, if this is a math or physics program.

I use single letter variable names sometimes to help keep the explanations clean and free of specific details. You should almost never use single letter variable names. Your variables should be named to help the reader understand what they stand for.

#### Good

   while (roomTemp < desiredTemp)
      room\_temp++;

#### Loop counters, also good

   for (n = 0; n < 10; n++)
   {
      <statement 1>;
      <statement 2>;
      <statement 3>;
   }

LABS.5.6 Rule Twelve
--------------------

Rule 12

Use _**lowerCamelCase**_ (a.k.a _**camelCase**_) for methodNames() or variableNames and UPPER\_CASE for constants.

Every working group has a convention for naming variables and method names. The most common for Java and much of C++ is **_lowerCamelCase_**, in which the first word is not capitalized, but every other word starts with a capital letter. Symbolic constants (values that you designate using the keywords **const or #define** as not being changeable at run-time) use **UPPER\_CASE** with, or without an underscore between words.

#### Bad

   for (k = 0; k < size; k++)
   {
      student\_name\[k\] = "undefined";  _<--not good variable style_
      for (j = 0; j < k; j++)
         score\[j\]\[k\] = GetScore(j, k); _<--method capitalized_
   }

#### Better

   for (k = 0; k < size; k++)
   {
      studentName\[k\] = "undefined";
      for (j = 0; j < k; j++)
         score\[j\]\[k\] = getScore(j, k);
   }

#### Bad

   const int maxStudents = 100;  _<--constant should be ALL\_CAPS_

   for (k = 0; k < maxStudents; k++)
      studentName\[k\] = "undefined"

#### Better

   const int MAX\_STUDENTS = 100;

   for (k = 0; k < MAX\_STUDENTS; k++)
      studentName\[k\] = "undefined"

**Exceptions** - We will see exceptions to these rules as we proceed, but they will be very easy to understand. For example, _**class names**_ are capitalized (called _**UpperCamelCase**_): **CityCenter**, and the _**constructors**_ for such classes have the same name as the class, **CityCenter()**.

LABS.5.7 Rule Thirteen
----------------------

Rule 13

Supply comments according to your professor's requirements.

As with all of style rules, this one only applies within the confines of this course; when you take another class or join a particular software group, they will have their own guidelines which will almost certainly be different from these, not to mention different from one-another's. This is particularly true regarding commentary.

#### Typical Comment Requirements of **_Other Groups_**

These are not necessarily the requirement of this course, but common rules for _other_ courses. To see this course's requirements skip ahead to "**This Course's Requirements.**"

1.  **When Not to Comment.** If variables or statements are self-explanatory, do not add a comment. "_assign **b** to **a**_", or _"print the result_" are examples of this type of unnecessary documentation. The more self-documenting code with well-named variables, the better.
2.  **Parameters and Returns.** Above each method declaration, list the **_parameters_** that the method takes and their meanings. Also include the purpose of the _**functional return**_, if any, and other lasting effect the method has on the caller (client).
3.  **Explanation of Code Fragments.** Above each several lines (two-to-ten, typically), include a brief comment (one or two lines at most) that explains what that code fragment does.
4.  **Individual Line Comments.** If a single line is particularly and technically unusual, add a brief comment on the same line indicating its meaning.

#### **_This Course's_** Requirements

In this class, I prefer _minimal_ commentary. You are more likely to lose points if you supply too many comments. A well written method with no commentary is perfectly acceptable in my class.

1.  **When Not to Comment (_same as above_).** If variables or statements are self-explanatory, do not add a comment.
2.  **No Comments for Most Methods or Fragments.** Well named methods with well named parameters and variables should be free of commentary. Code fragments that are clearly designed do not need comments above them. When you feel a fragment needs qualification, the comment above should be restricted to _**one line**_.
3.  **Comment Alignment.** A Comment for a code fragment must be aligned with code below just as it would be were it an ordinary (e.g. assignment) statement.

You will get excellent practice and guidance with the first set of rules ("_Other Groups_") in other instructors' courses. Here we want to de-emphasize comments in order to encourage well designed and self-documenting code. My experience in many years of teaching coding at this introductorty level is that the more comments students include in their code, the more complex and incorrect the actual code is. Specifically, it appears that students often lean on comments as a way to excuse variable and method names that are sub-optimal or logic that is inscrutible without the explanation.

You will get no points for excess commentary, but will lose points for unnecessary, distracting comments or if your code is unclear on its own merit.

LABS.5.8 Final Check
--------------------

After you paste your homework into a text file for final submission, you should review it to be sure your compiler and text editor have not conspired to add any strange formatting. If they have, you will still be responsible for those errors. Manually fix the errors in your source code.  

For more information on style, you should look closely at the examples.
