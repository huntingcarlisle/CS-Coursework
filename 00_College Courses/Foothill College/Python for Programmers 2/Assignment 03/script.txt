We, at ArTech, have developed
something that will change the way
the VTF approaches these incidents.

The Mayor laughs.

MAYOR
You've your grandfather's flare for
showmanship, Miss Ligero-Walker.

LAURIE
I consider myself an innovator, but
I appreciate the compliment.

The Mayor gestures for Laurie to continue. She moves to the
table and reveals a VP Scanner.

LAURIE (CONT’D)
Everyone here knows the ArTech's VP
Scanner. This tool allows the VTF
to accurately locate any number of
variant's within the scanner's
range.
Omega projects a simulation of how the scanner works. A
circular map of city blocks with dots representing variants.
OZ
When the damn thing works.

LAURIE
But the VP Scanner is merely a
surveillance tool. We began to
wonder if we could do more. What if
instead of simply identifying a
variant's location, we were able to
identify a variant's ability and
effectively disable them?
Omega projects a hologram of a brain.

LAURIE (CONT’D)
I imagine most of you own one of
our ArDot smart devices. And are
familiar with the AI assistant,
Omega. Developed as a personal
assistant app, we realized it could
be more. Combining Q-Learning with
decision-tree algorithms, Omega can
make predictive models for pretty
much anything.
